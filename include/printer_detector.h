 * @brief Printer auto-detection using hardware fingerprints
 *
 * Data-driven printer detection system that loads heuristics from JSON database.
 * Analyzes hardware discovery data to identify printer models based on
 * distinctive patterns found in real printers (FlashForge AD5M Pro, Voron V2, etc.).
 *
 * This class is completely independent of UI code and printer type lists.
 * It returns printer type names as strings, which the caller can map to their
 * own data structures (e.g., UI dropdowns, config values).
 *
 * Detection heuristics are defined in data/printer_database.json, allowing
 * new printer types to be added without recompilation.
 *
 * **Contract**: Returned type_name strings should match printer names in
 * PrinterTypes::PRINTER_TYPES_ROLLER for UI integration, but the detector
 * doesn't depend on that list and can be tested independently.
