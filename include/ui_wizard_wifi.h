/**
 * Wizard WiFi Setup Screen
 *
 * Handles WiFi configuration during first-run wizard:
 * - WiFi on/off toggle
 * - Network scanning and selection
 * - Password entry for secured networks
 * - Connection status feedback
 * - Ethernet status display
 *
 * Initialization Order (CRITICAL):
 *   1. Register XML components (wizard_wifi_setup.xml, wifi_password_modal.xml)
 *   2. ui_wizard_wifi_init_subjects()
 *   3. ui_wizard_wifi_register_callbacks()
 *   4. ui_wizard_wifi_create(parent)
 *   5. ui_wizard_wifi_init_wifi_manager() <- Start WiFi backend integration
 *
 * NOTE: WiFi screen responsive constants (wifi_card_height, wifi_toggle_height, etc.)
 *       are now registered by ui_wizard_container_register_responsive_constants()
 *       and propagated to this screen automatically.
