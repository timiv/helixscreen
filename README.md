Your printer can do way more than your current touchscreen lets you. Bed mesh visualization, input shaper graphs, multi-material management, print history — it's all trapped in a browser tab. HelixScreen puts it at your fingertips.

Fast, beautiful, and built for every Klipper printer — from a Creality K1 to a tricked-out Voron or RatRig.

---

> **Beta Release — v0.9.13**
>
> Core features are complete and stabilizing. We're looking for testers across different printer setups.
>
> **Tested on:** Voron 2.4 (Raspberry Pi 5), Voron 0.2, Doron Velta, RatRig V-Core, FlashForge Adventurer 5M Pro ([Forge-X](https://github.com/DrA1ex/ff5m) firmware)
>
> **Raspberry Pi:** Both 64-bit and 32-bit Raspberry Pi OS are supported.
>
> **QIDI:** Supported with auto-detection heuristics and print start profile.
>
> **Snapmaker U1:** Cross-compile target with 480x320 display support.
>
> **Creality K1:** Binaries are included in the release but have **not been tested on hardware**. If you have a K1, we'd love your help verifying it works!
>
> **Creality K2:** Build target exists (ARM, static musl) but is **completely untested**. Stock Moonraker on port 4408 makes this a promising target. If you have a K2/K2 Plus with SSH access, we'd love your help!

## Installation

> **⚠️ Run these commands on your printer's host computer, not your local machine.**
>
> SSH into your Raspberry Pi, BTT CB1/Manta, or similar host as root. For all-in-one printers (Creality K1, K2 series, Adventurer 5M/Pro), SSH directly into the printer itself.

**Raspberry Pi / Creality K1:**
```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prestonbrown/helixscreen/main/scripts/install.sh | sh
```

**Adventurer 5M/Pro:** Requires downloading to your computer first, then copying to the printer (BusyBox lacks HTTPS support).

See [Installation Guide](docs/user/INSTALL.md) for detailed instructions, display configuration, and troubleshooting.

## Development

```bash
# Check/install dependencies
make check-deps && make install-deps

# Build
make -j

# Run with mock printer (no hardware needed)
./build/bin/helix-screen --test

# Run with real printer
./build/bin/helix-screen
```

**Controls:** Click navigation icons, press 'S' for screenshot, use `-v` or `-vv` for logging.

See [docs/DEVELOPMENT.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md) for detailed setup, cross-compilation, and test modes.

## FAQ

**Is HelixScreen production-ready?**
Beta status. Core features are stable and improving with each release. Suitable for enthusiasts willing to provide feedback.

**How is this different from GuppyScreen/KlipperScreen?**
More features, way less resource usage (~10MB RAM vs ~50MB for KlipperScreen), and actively developed. See the [comparison table](#why-helixscreen).

**Which printers are supported?**
Any Klipper + Moonraker printer. Tested on Voron 2.4, Voron 0.2, Doron Velta, RatRig V-Core, FlashForge Adventurer 5M Pro, and QIDI printers. Snapmaker U1 support included. Both 64-bit and 32-bit Raspberry Pi OS are supported. Creality K1 and K2 series binaries are available but untested. The wizard auto-discovers your printer's capabilities.

**What screen sizes are supported?**
800×480, 1024×600, and 1920×480 (ultrawide) are fully supported with auto-detecting layout system. Display rotation (0/90/180/270) is supported. Smaller displays like 480×320 (Snapmaker U1) are a work-in-progress.

**What multi-material systems work?**
AFC (Box Turtle), Happy Hare (ERCF, 3MS, Tradrack), tool changers, and ValgACE.

See [docs/user/FAQ.md](docs/user/FAQ.md) for the full FAQ.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| SDL2 or build tools missing | `make install-deps` |
| Submodule empty | `git submodule update --init --recursive` |
| Can't connect to Moonraker | Check IP/port in helixconfig.json |
| Wizard not showing | Delete helixconfig.json to trigger it |

See [docs/user/TROUBLESHOOTING.md](docs/user/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for more solutions, or open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/prestonbrown/helixscreen/issues).
