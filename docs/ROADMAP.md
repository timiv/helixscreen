## Recently Completed

### Print Completion Stats ✅
**Completed:** 2026-02-11

Enhanced print completion modal and live print status with detailed statistics:
- **Filament usage subject**: Real-time `filament_used` tracking from Moonraker's print_stats
- **format_filament_length()**: Human-readable filament display (850mm, 12.5m, 1.23km)
- **Completion modal**: Shows duration, slicer estimate, layers, and filament used
- **Live filament on print status**: Evolving consumption displayed during active printing
- **Mock improvements**: Simulated filament consumption proportional to progress

**Files:** `format_utils.cpp`, `print_completion.cpp`, `printer_print_state.cpp`, `ui_panel_print_status.cpp`
**Tests:** 15 test cases for filament formatting

### Pre-Print ETA Prediction ✅
**Completed:** 2026-02-11

Predicts how long the preparation phase (heating, homing, leveling) will take based on historical timing data:
- **PreprintPredictor**: Pure-logic weighted-average predictor using last 3 print start timings
- Phase-level timing history stored in config (`/print_start_history/entries`)
- Real-time "time remaining" display during PRINT_START with per-phase weighting
- FIFO entry management with 15-minute anomaly rejection
- Integration with PrintStartCollector for automatic timing capture

**Files:** `preprint_predictor.h`, `print_start_collector.h`, `printer_print_state.h`
**Tests:** 18 test cases covering weighting, FIFO, edge cases

### Comprehensive AFC Support ✅
**Completed:** 2026-02-07

Full parsing and command support for AFC (Box Turtle) multi-filament systems:
- **Bug fixes:** `current_state` field priority, tool mapping from `map` field, endless spool from `runout_lane`, AFC message parsing with error dedup
- **Full data parsing:** Hub bowden length, stepper extended fields (`buffer_status`, `filament_status`, `dist_hub`), buffer objects, global state (`quiet_mode`, `led_state`)
- **11 device actions:** Calibration wizard, bowden length, test lanes, change blade, park, brush, reset motor, LED toggle, quiet mode, forward/reverse speed
- **Error recovery:** Differentiated `reset()` (AFC_HOME) vs `recover()` (AFC_RESET), per-lane reset (`AFC_LANE_RESET`)
- **Mock AFC mode:** Realistic Box Turtle simulation via `HELIX_MOCK_AMS_TYPE=afc`
- **Live smoke test:** `scripts/afc-test.sh` validates all AFC objects and detects field drift

**Files:** `ams_backend_afc.cpp`, `ams_backend_afc.h`, `ams_backend_mock.cpp`, 8 fixture files
**Tests:** 92 test cases, 173 assertions (phases tagged `[phase1]`-`[phase4]`)

### Input Shaper Calibration ✅
**Completed:** 2026-01-22

Full resonance compensation workflow:
- Calibration trigger for X/Y axes + accelerometer noise check
- Frequency response chart (hardware-adaptive: full/simplified/table based on platform)
- Results display with recommended shaper + 5 alternatives (frequency, vibrations, smoothing)
- Apply (session) / Save Config (persistent) / Test Print (TUNING_TOWER) workflow
- 30-day persistent cache with printer ID matching
- First-run wizard integration (optional step, auto-skipped if no ADXL)
- Platform tier detection (EMBEDDED/BASIC/STANDARD) for UI adaptation

**Files:** `input_shaper_calibrator.cpp`, `ui_panel_input_shaper.cpp`, `ui_frequency_response_chart.cpp`

**Files:** `filament_database.h`, `ui_panel_filament.cpp`, `ui_ams_edit_modal.cpp`

### God Class Decomposition ✅
**Completed:** 2026-01-12

Major architectural improvements:

## Current Priorities

### 1. Plugin Ecosystem

**Status:** Core infrastructure complete, expanding ecosystem

The plugin system launched with version checking, UI injection points, and async execution.

**Next steps:**
- [ ] LED Effects plugin → production quality
- [ ] Additional plugin examples for community
- [ ] Plugin documentation refinement

**Files:** `src/plugin_manager.cpp`, `docs/PLUGIN_DEVELOPMENT.md`

### 2. Production Hardening

Remaining items for production readiness:
- [ ] Structured logging with log rotation
- [ ] Edge case testing (print failures, filesystem errors)
- [ ] Streaming file operations verified on AD5M with 50MB+ G-code files

## Backlog (Lower Priority)

| Feature | Effort | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| **Lazy panel initialization** | Medium | Defer `init_subjects()` until first nav; blocked on LVGL XML subject timing |
| **Camera/Webcam** | Low | Lower priority for local touchscreen use case |
| **Belt tension visualization** | Future | Accelerometer-based CoreXY belt comparison; reuses frequency chart |
| **OTA updates** | Future | Currently requires manual binary update |

See `docs/IDEAS.md` for additional ideas and design rationale.

## Known Technical Debt

See `docs/ARCHITECTURAL_DEBT.md` for the full register.

**Resolved (2026-01):**
- ~~PrinterState god class~~ → Decomposed into 13 domain classes
- ~~PrintStatusPanel~~ → Extracted 8 focused components
- ~~SettingsPanel~~ → Extracted 5 overlay components

**Remaining:**
- **Application class** (1249 lines) → Extract bootstrapper and runtime
- **Singleton cascade pattern** → UIPanelContext value object
- **Code duplication** → SubjectManagedPanel base class (in progress)
- **NavigationManager intimacy** → Extract INavigable interface

## Design Philosophy

HelixScreen is a **local touchscreen** UI - users are physically present at the printer. This fundamentally differs from web UIs (Mainsail/Fluidd) designed for remote monitoring.

**We prioritize:**
- Tactile controls optimized for touch
- At-a-glance information for the user standing at the machine
- Calibration workflows (PID, Z-offset, screws tilt, input shaper)
- Real-time tuning (speed, flow, firmware retraction)

**Lower priority for this form factor:**
- Camera (you can see the printer with your eyes)
- Job queue (requires manual print removal between jobs)
- System stats (CPU/memory) — not diagnosing remote issues
- Remote access/monitoring features

Don't copy features from web UIs just because "competitors have it" — evaluate whether it makes sense for a local touchscreen.
