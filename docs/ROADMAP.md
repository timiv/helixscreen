  - Icon color updates based on active panel

**Key Learnings:**
- Never call `SDL_PollEvent()` manually - violates LVGL display driver abstraction
- Must create mouse input device with `lv_sdl_mouse_create()` for clicks
- Event handlers in C++ with `lv_obj_add_event_cb()` for `LV_EVENT_CLICKED`
- Labels must have `LV_OBJ_FLAG_EVENT_BUBBLE` and not be clickable for clicks to reach buttons

## 📋 Phase 3: Print Select Panel Core (COMPLETED)

  - [x] format_modified_date() - Formats timestamps to "Jan 15 14:30"

**Completed:** 2025-10-12 Evening

**Key Decisions:**
- Simplified list view from 7 columns to 4 (removed Thumbnail, Filament, Slicer for clarity)
- View toggle shows opposite mode icon (intuitive: shows where you'll go, not where you are)

- `ui_wizard_helpers.h` for dropdown population and config save/restore
- Responsive constants for small/medium/large displays

### User Story
New users need a guided setup wizard to:
1. Connect to their Moonraker instance (manual IP entry)
2. Map auto-discovered printer components to UI defaults
3. Save these mappings for consistent behavior

### Requirements (All Complete)

- [x] **First-Run Detection** ✅
  - [x] Detect missing/incomplete configuration on startup
  - [x] Show wizard automatically on first run
  - [x] Allow re-run from settings panel ("Reset Configuration")
  - [x] Skip wizard if config is complete

  - [x] Manual IP address entry field with RFC 1035 validation
  - [x] Port configuration field (default 7125)
  - [x] "Test Connection" button with spinner/status feedback
  - [x] Connection status display (success/error messages)
  - [x] "Next" button (disabled until successful connection via `connection_test_passed` subject)
  - [x] Save connection settings to helixconfig.json
  - [ ] Future enhancement: mDNS/Bonjour auto-discovery scan

- [x] **Hardware Mapping Wizard** ✅
  - [x] Auto-detect available components via printer.objects.list
  - [x] Multi-screen wizard flow (one category per screen):
    1. ✅ **Heated Bed Selection** - Dropdown filtered by "bed" keyword
    2. ✅ **Hotend Selection** - Dropdown filtered by "extruder"/"hotend"
    3. ✅ **Fan Selection** - Hotend fan + part cooling fan dropdowns
    4. ✅ **LED Selection** - Optional LED strip with "None" option
  - [x] Back/Next navigation buttons on each screen
  - [x] Summary screen showing all selections before saving
  - [x] Save mappings to config file under printer-specific section

- [x] **Configuration Storage** ✅
  - [x] helixconfig.json schema with hardware mappings
  - [x] Config save/restore via `ui_wizard_helpers.h`
  - [x] `wizard_config_paths.h` defines all JSON pointer paths

- [x] **UI Components** ✅
  - [x] Wizard container with progress indicator, back/next/finish buttons
  - [x] Textarea input fields with validation
  - [x] Dropdown/roller widgets for component selection
  - [x] Success/error status messages via `wizard_header_bar.xml` subtitle

### Design Notes

- **Auto-default behavior:** If only one obvious component exists (e.g., single heater_bed, single extruder), pre-select it and skip that wizard screen
- **Validation:** Ensure selections are valid before allowing user to proceed
- **User control:** Always allow manual override of auto-detected defaults
- **mDNS Discovery:** Future enhancement - Moonraker supports zeroconf component but not universally enabled. Manual IP entry is primary method.

### Dependencies

- MoonrakerClient auto-discovery functional
- Config system with JSON pointer API

### Testing

- [x] Test with no config file (first run)
- [x] Test with partial config (migration)

- [x] **All 13+ panels migrated** - Home, Controls, Motion, Temps, Print Select, etc.
- [x] **Wizard steps migrated** - All 7 wizard steps use class-based pattern
- [x] **Deprecated wrappers removed** - Clean break from old function-based API
- [x] **ObserverGuard RAII pattern** (2025-11-29) - Safe observer subscription lifecycle
  - Automatic unsubscription on destruction
  - Applied to HomePanel, PrintStatusOverlay, FilamentOverlay, ExtrusionOverlay
  - Fixes crash from LVGL observer immediate-fire pattern

**Benefits:**
- RAII lifecycle management
- Consistent show/hide behavior

## 📐 Phase 15: Reactive UI Architecture (MOSTLY COMPLETE)

**Priority: Medium** - Eliminate imperative UI flag manipulation in favor of declarative XML bindings

**Status: MOSTLY COMPLETE** - Core refactoring done, remaining items have complexity > benefit

### Overview
Convert imperative `lv_obj_add_flag()`/`lv_obj_remove_flag()` calls to reactive XML bindings using `<lv_obj-bind_flag_if_eq>` elements. This makes UI state declarative and self-documenting.

### Completed ✅

- [x] **Temperature Panel X-axis Labels** (`922e918`)
  - Subject: `nozzle_graph_points`, `bed_graph_points`
  - Labels hidden until 60+ data points using `<lv_obj-bind_flag_if_lt>`

- [x] **Extrusion Panel Safety Warning** (`2384501`)
  - Subject: `extrusion_safety_warning_visible`
  - Warning shown/hidden via reactive binding

- [x] **Filament Panel Safety Warning** (`2384501`)
  - Subject: `filament_safety_warning_visible`
  - Warning shown/hidden via reactive binding

- [x] **Print Status G-code Viewer Mode** (`2384501`)
  - Subject: `gcode_viewer_mode`
  - Gradient, thumbnail, and viewer visibility controlled reactively

- [x] **Notification History Empty State** (`2384501`)
  - Subject: `notification_has_entries`
  - Content/empty state visibility controlled reactively

- [x] **Controls Panel Clickable Cards** (`8b1881c`)
  - XML attribute: `clickable="true"` on 5 cards
  - Removed 5 `lv_obj_add_flag(LV_OBJ_FLAG_CLICKABLE)` calls

- [x] **Settings Panel Clickable Card** (`8b1881c`)
  - XML attribute: `clickable="true"` on bed_mesh card
  - Removed 1 `lv_obj_add_flag(LV_OBJ_FLAG_CLICKABLE)` call

- [x] **Print Select View Mode Toggle** (`8b1881c`)
  - Subject: `print_select_view_mode` (0=CARD, 1=LIST)
  - Card/list container visibility controlled reactively

### Skipped (Complexity > Benefit)

- Empty state with compound conditions (empty AND view_mode)
- Sort indicators (8 compound conditions for 4 columns × 2 directions)
- Directory card metadata (dynamic per-card creation)

### Key Pattern
```xml
<!-- In XML: Declare visibility rule -->
<lv_obj name="warning_container">
  <lv_obj-bind_flag_if_eq subject="safety_warning_visible" flag="hidden" ref_value="0"/>
</lv_obj>

<!-- In C++: Just update the subject -->
lv_subject_set_int(&safety_warning_subject_, show ? 1 : 0);
```

### Benefits
- UI behavior visible in XML layout files
- C++ code focuses on business logic, not presentation
- Easier to understand and maintain
- Self-documenting state management

## Notes

- **Reactive Pattern:** All UI updates should use Subject-Observer pattern
- **XML First:** Prefer XML layout over C++ when possible
- **Clean Separation:** Keep business logic in C++, layout in XML
- **Documentation:** Update guides as patterns emerge
- **UI Patterns:** Document reusable patterns in LVGL9_XML_GUIDE.md (e.g., vertical accent bars, dynamic card components)
- **Responsive Design:** Use constants in globals.xml for easy layout adjustments (4-col vs 3-col grids)
- **Testing:** Test each phase before moving to next
