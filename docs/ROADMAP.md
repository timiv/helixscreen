# LVGL 9 XML UI Prototype - Development Roadmap

## ✅ Phase 1: Foundation (COMPLETED)

- [x] LVGL 9.3 setup with XML support
- [x] Navigation bar with proper flex layout
- [x] Home panel with declarative XML
- [x] Reactive data binding (Subject-Observer pattern)
- [x] Theme system with global constants
- [x] FontAwesome icon integration with auto-generation
- [x] Screenshot utility supporting multiple binaries
- [x] Comprehensive documentation
- [x] C++ wrappers for XML panels with clean API
- [x] LVGL logging integration

## ✅ Phase 2: Navigation & Blank Panels (COMPLETED)

**Priority: High** - Enable panel switching with reactive navbar highlighting

- [x] **Navigation State Management**
  - Active panel tracking via integer subject
  - Navbar button click handlers (C++ event handlers)
  - Panel visibility toggling (show/hide based on active state)
  - Reactive navbar icon highlighting (red #ff4444 for active, white #ffffff for inactive)

- [x] **Blank Placeholder Panels**
  - Home panel (with printer status content)
  - Controls panel (blank placeholder)
  - Filament panel (blank placeholder)
  - Settings panel (blank placeholder)
  - Advanced panel (blank placeholder)

- [x] **Navigation Implementation**
  - Updated navigation_bar.xml with FontAwesome icons
  - Created C++ wrapper (ui_nav.cpp) with Subject-Observer pattern
  - Panel switching via clickable navigation icons
  - Icon color updates based on active panel

**Key Learnings:**
- Never call `SDL_PollEvent()` manually - violates LVGL display driver abstraction
- Must create mouse input device with `lv_sdl_mouse_create()` for clicks
- Event handlers in C++ with `lv_obj_add_event_cb()` for `LV_EVENT_CLICKED`
- Labels must have `LV_OBJ_FLAG_EVENT_BUBBLE` and not be clickable for clicks to reach buttons

## Current Status

**Active Phase:** Phase 3 - Additional Panel Content

**Recent Work (2025-10-11):**
- Implemented vertical accent bar UI pattern in home panel
- Consolidated documentation into comprehensive LVGL9_XML_GUIDE.md
- Created UI review system with automated screenshot verification

**Next Milestone:** Build out content for remaining panels (Controls, Filament, Settings, Advanced)

**Completed Phases:** 1, 2

**Phase 2 Completion Date:** 2025-10-08

## Notes

- **Reactive Pattern:** All UI updates should use Subject-Observer pattern
- **XML First:** Prefer XML layout over C++ when possible
- **Clean Separation:** Keep business logic in C++, layout in XML
- **Documentation:** Update guides as patterns emerge
- **UI Patterns:** Document reusable patterns in LVGL9_XML_GUIDE.md (e.g., vertical accent bars)
- **Testing:** Test each phase before moving to next
