# Temperature Control

![Temperature Controls](../../images/user/controls-temperature.png)

---

## Nozzle Temperature Panel

- **Current temperature**: Live reading from thermistor
- **Target input**: Tap to enter exact temperature
- **Presets**: Quick buttons for common temperatures
- **Temperature graph**: History over time

---

## Bed Temperature Panel

Same layout as nozzle control:

- Current and target temperature
- Presets for common materials
- Temperature graph

---

## Temperature Presets

Built-in presets:

| Material | Nozzle | Bed |
|----------|--------|-----|
| Off | 0°C | 0°C |
| PLA | 210°C | 60°C |
| PETG | 240°C | 80°C |
| ABS | 250°C | 100°C |

Tap a preset to set both current and target. Custom presets can be configured via Klipper macros.

## Multi-Extruder Temperature Control

On printers with multiple extruders, an extruder selector appears at the top of the Temperature Control panel:

- **Tap an extruder** to switch which one you are controlling
- Each extruder has independent temperature targets and presets
- Toolchanger printers show tool names (T0, T1) rather than "Nozzle 1", "Nozzle 2"
- The selector only appears when Klipper reports more than one extruder

Single-extruder printers are unaffected — the panel works exactly as before.

## Chamber Temperature Panel

If your printer has a chamber heater or chamber temperature sensor configured in Klipper, you can access the Chamber Temperature panel by tapping the chamber row in the **Temperatures** widget on the Home Panel.

- **Heated chambers** (`heater_generic chamber`): Full control panel with current/target temperature, presets, and a live temperature graph with a green trace
- **Sensor-only chambers** (`temperature_sensor chamber`): Monitoring mode — shows the current chamber temperature and graph, with a "Monitoring" status instead of heating controls. Presets and target input are hidden since there's no heater to control.

The chamber panel works identically to the nozzle and bed panels, just with chamber-specific presets and colors.

## Temperature Graphs

Live graphs show:

- **Current temperature** (solid line)
- **Target temperature** (dashed line)
- **History** scrolling over time

Useful for diagnosing heating issues or verifying PID tuning.
