# Beta Features

HelixScreen includes several features that are functional but still being refined. These are gated behind a beta flag so they can be tested without affecting the default experience.

---

## Enabling Beta Features

**Method 1: Secret tap (recommended)**

1. Go to **Settings > About**
2. Tap the **Current Version** button **7 times** (like enabling Android Developer Mode)
3. A countdown appears after 4 taps ("3 more taps...", "2 more taps...", etc.)
4. A toast confirms "Beta features: ON"

Repeat the same process to disable beta features.

> **Note:** Taps must be within 2 seconds of each other or the counter resets.

**Method 2: Config file**

Set `"beta_features": true` in your `helixconfig.json`.

**Method 3: Test mode**

Beta features are always enabled when running with `--test`.

## Update Channel Selection

When beta features are enabled, a channel selector appears in **Settings > About**:

| Channel | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Stable** | Production releases (default) |
| **Beta** | Pre-release builds for testing upcoming features |
| **Dev** | Development builds — latest code, may be unstable |

The update channel can also be set via `update.channel` in the config file (0=Stable, 1=Beta, 2=Dev).
