## Introduction

HelixScreen is a modern touchscreen interface for Klipper 3D printers. It connects to your printer via Moonraker and provides intuitive controls for printing, temperature management, calibration, and more.

### Quick Reference

| Sidebar Icon | Panel | What You'll Do There |
|--------------|-------|----------------------|
| 🏠 Home | Home | Monitor status, start prints, view temperatures |
| 🎚 Tune | Controls | Move axes, set temperatures, control fans |
| 🧵 Spool | Filament | Load/unload filament, manage AMS slots |
| ⚙️ Gear | Settings | Configure display, sound, network, sensors |
| ⋯ More | Advanced | Calibration, history, macros, system tools |

### Navigation Basics

HelixScreen uses a consistent layout:

- **Left sidebar**: Five navigation buttons to switch between main panels
- **Back arrow**: Returns from sub-panels to the parent panel
- **Tap**: Select buttons, open panels, activate controls
- **Swipe**: Scroll through lists and long content

> **Note:** The Print Select panel is accessed by tapping the print area on the Home panel, not from the sidebar. The Controls and Filament panels require an active printer connection.

### Connection Status

The Home panel shows your printer connection status:

| Indicator | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| Green checkmark | Connected and ready |
| Red X | Disconnected (auto-reconnect in progress) |
| Yellow exclamation | Klipper not ready (firmware restart needed) |

When disconnected, a toast notification appears and HelixScreen attempts to reconnect automatically every few seconds.

---

## First-Time Setup

When you first start HelixScreen, the Setup Wizard guides you through initial configuration.

### Setup Wizard Overview

The wizard walks you through these steps:

1. **Language selection** - Choose your interface language
2. **WiFi configuration** - Connect to your wireless network (if needed)
3. **Printer connection** - Enter your Moonraker address
4. **Hardware discovery** - Identify heaters, fans, sensors, and LEDs
5. **Touch calibration** - Calibrate your touchscreen (if applicable)
6. **Summary** - Review your configuration

You can re-run the wizard anytime via **Settings > Factory Reset**.

### WiFi Configuration

If your device needs WiFi:

1. Available networks appear in a list
2. Tap a network to select it
3. Enter the password using the on-screen keyboard
4. Tap **Connect** and wait for confirmation

The wizard shows signal strength for each network and indicates which one you're currently connected to.

### Printer Connection

Enter your Moonraker connection details:

- **Hostname or IP**: Your printer's address (e.g., `voron.local` or `192.168.1.100`)
- **Port**: Usually `7125` (the default)
- **API Key**: Only needed if Moonraker requires authentication

HelixScreen auto-discovers printers on your network when possible. Tap a discovered printer to auto-fill the connection details.

### Hardware Discovery

HelixScreen scans your Klipper configuration and identifies:

- **Heaters**: Hotend, bed, chamber (if present)
- **Fans**: Part cooling, hotend, auxiliary fans
- **Sensors**: Filament runout, probes, accelerometers
- **LEDs**: Chamber lights, status LEDs
- **AMS**: Multi-material systems (Happy Hare, AFC-Klipper)

For each category, confirm which hardware should be monitored and controlled. You can adjust these later in **Settings > Sensors** and **Settings > Hardware Health**.

### Touch Calibration

On touchscreen displays, you'll be prompted to tap calibration targets:

1. Tap each crosshair target as it appears (usually 4-5 points)
2. Tap as close to the center of each target as possible
3. Calibration saves automatically when complete

If your touchscreen feels inaccurate later, recalibrate via **Settings > Touch Calibration**.

---

## Touch Screen Basics

HelixScreen supports these touch interactions:

| Gesture | Action |
|---------|--------|
| **Tap** | Select buttons, open panels, toggle options |
| **Swipe** | Scroll lists, move through content |
| **Long press** | Access alternate characters on keyboard |
| **Pinch/spread** | Zoom 3D views (G-code preview, bed mesh) |

Temperature displays are tappable shortcuts—tap the nozzle or bed temperature on the Home panel to jump directly to that temperature control panel.

---

## Home Panel

![Home Panel](../images/user/home.png)

The Home Panel is your printer dashboard showing status at a glance.

### Status Area

The top area displays:

- **Printer state**: Idle, Printing, Paused, Complete, Error
- **Print progress**: Percentage and time remaining (when printing)
- **Current filename**: What's being printed
- **Connection indicator**: Your link to Moonraker/Klipper

### Temperature Displays

Real-time temperature readouts show:

- **Nozzle**: Current / Target temperature
- **Bed**: Current / Target temperature
- **Chamber**: Current temperature (if equipped)

**Tap any temperature** to jump directly to its control panel.

### AMS/Filament Status

If you have a multi-material system (Happy Hare, AFC-Klipper, Bambu AMS):

- Visual display of loaded filament slots
- Current active slot highlighted
- Color indicators from Spoolman (if integrated)
- Tap to access the Filament panel

### Quick Actions

Buttons for common operations:

- **LED Toggle**: Turn chamber/printer lights on/off
- **Emergency Stop**: Halt all motion immediately (confirmation required unless disabled in Safety Settings)

---

## Printing Workflow

### Selecting a File

![Print Select Panel](../images/user/print-select.png)

1. From the **Home panel**, tap the print file area (shows "Select a file" when idle)
2. Browse your G-code files from Moonraker's virtual SD card

**View options:**

- **Card View** (default): Thumbnails with file info—estimated time, filament usage, slicer
- **List View**: Compact view for browsing many files (toggle with the view button in top-right)

**Sorting options** (tap the sort button):

- Name (A-Z or Z-A)
- Modified date (newest or oldest first)
- Size (largest or smallest)
- Print time (longest or shortest)

### File Preview

Tap a file to see the preview panel:

- **3D G-code preview**: Rotatable with touch, showing the toolpath
- **Layer slider**: Scrub through layers to inspect the print
- **Metadata**: File size, estimated time, filament usage, slicer used
- **Thumbnail**: Embedded preview image (if your slicer generates one)

### Pre-Print Options

Before starting, you can enable or disable:

| Option | What It Does |
|--------|--------------|
| Auto bed level | Run bed mesh calibration before print |
| Quad gantry level | Run QGL calibration (for gantry printers) |
| Z-tilt adjust | Run Z-tilt calibration |
| Nozzle clean | Execute your cleaning macro |

These options modify the G-code on-the-fly—if you disable "Auto bed level" but your G-code contains `BED_MESH_CALIBRATE`, HelixScreen comments it out so it doesn't run.

> **Tip:** Pre-print options remember your preferences per slicer. If you always run bed mesh before PrusaSlicer prints, that preference persists.

### Starting a Print

1. Select your file
2. Review and set pre-print options
3. Tap **Start Print**

The UI switches to the Print Status panel automatically.

### During a Print

![Print Status Panel](../images/user/print-status.png)

The Print Status panel shows:

- **Circular progress indicator** with percentage
- **Time elapsed** and **time remaining**
- **Current layer** / total layers
- **Filename** and thumbnail

**Print controls:**

| Button | Action |
|--------|--------|
| **Pause** | Parks nozzle safely, pauses print |
| **Resume** | Continues from paused state |
| **Cancel** | Stops print (confirmation required) |
| **Tune** | Opens Print Tune overlay for real-time adjustments |

### Print Tune Overlay

![Print Tune Overlay](../images/user/print-tune.png)

Access by tapping **Tune** during an active print.

| Parameter | Range | What It Does |
|-----------|-------|--------------|
| Speed % | 10-300% | Overall print speed multiplier |
| Flow % | 75-125% | Extrusion rate multiplier |
| Fan % | 0-100% | Part cooling fan speed |

**When to adjust:**

- **Speed %**: Slow down (50-70%) for intricate details or if you see layer separation. Speed up for large infill areas.
- **Flow %**: Increase (105-110%) if you see gaps between extrusion lines. Decrease (95-98%) for blobs or over-packed lines.
- **Fan %**: Increase for better bridging and overhangs. Decrease or disable for ABS/ASA to prevent warping.

> **Note:** Tune adjustments are temporary and only affect the current print. The next print uses your slicer's original values.

### Z-Offset / Baby Steps

Fine-tune your first layer height while printing:

**Adjustment increments:**

- **-0.05mm / -0.01mm**: Nozzle closer to bed (more squish)
- **+0.01mm / +0.05mm**: Nozzle further from bed (less squish)

**Signs you need to adjust:**

| Symptom | Problem | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Lines not sticking, curling up | Nozzle too high | Tap **-0.01** or **-0.05** |
| Rough first layer, scratching sounds | Nozzle too low | Tap **+0.01** or **+0.05** |
| Gaps between lines | Nozzle too high | Tap **-0.01** |
| Elephant foot, ridges | Nozzle too low | Tap **+0.01** or **+0.05** |

**Saving your Z-Offset:**

1. Get the first layer looking good
2. Tap **Save Z-Offset** to write to Klipper config
3. Future prints use this as the starting point

> **Tip:** Make small adjustments (0.01mm) and wait for the printer to complete a few moves before judging the result.

### Pressure Advance Tuning

If your printer has Pressure Advance configured:

1. Tap **Tune** during a print
2. Find **Pressure Advance** section (only visible if PA is enabled in Klipper)
3. Adjust the value

**Typical values by material:**

| Material | PA Range |
|----------|----------|
| PLA | 0.02 - 0.06 |
| PETG | 0.04 - 0.10 |
| ABS/ASA | 0.03 - 0.08 |
| TPU | 0.10 - 0.20 |

**When to adjust:**

- **Bulging corners**: Increase PA by 0.01-0.02
- **Gaps at line starts**: Decrease PA by 0.01-0.02

### Exclude Object

If your slicer supports object labels (OrcaSlicer, SuperSlicer):

1. Tap **Exclude Object** during a print
2. See a list of printable objects
3. Select an object to skip (e.g., a failed part)
4. **Undo** is available for 5 seconds after exclusion

This lets you salvage a print when one object fails without canceling the entire job.

### After a Print

When a print completes:

- Status shows **Complete** with total time
- Notification sound plays (if enabled)
- Print is logged to history

## Tips & Best Practices

### Workflow Tips

**Temperature shortcuts**: Tap temperature displays on the Home panel to jump directly to temperature controls.

**Pre-print options**: These remember your choices per slicer—if you always mesh before PrusaSlicer prints, it persists.

**Quick homing**: Use "Home All" before starting manual positioning to ensure known coordinates.

**Save Z-offset during first layer**: Make baby step adjustments, then save while you can see the results.
