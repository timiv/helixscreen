# Frequently Asked Questions

Quick answers to common questions about HelixScreen.

---

## General

### What is HelixScreen?

HelixScreen is a touchscreen interface for Klipper 3D printers. It connects to your Moonraker instance and provides a modern, touch-friendly UI for controlling your printer.

**Key features:**
- 30 panels and 48 overlays covering all printer operations
- 3D G-code preview, bed mesh visualization, frequency response charts
- First-run wizard with telemetry opt-in
- Theme editor with 14 presets (dark and light)
- Sound system, timelapse integration, filament tracking
- Auto-detecting layout system for multiple display sizes
- Designed for embedded displays (low memory, no desktop required)

### Which printers are supported?

**Any printer running Klipper + Moonraker** should work. HelixScreen connects to Moonraker's API, not directly to Klipper.

**Tested and confirmed working:**
- Voron 0.1, Voron 2.4
- Doron Velta
- RatRig V-Core
- FlashForge Adventurer 5M / 5M Pro (with [Forge-X](https://github.com/DrA1ex/ff5m)) — most thoroughly tested on ForgeX 1.4.0 with FlashForge firmware 3.1.5; other versions may work fine

**Supported with auto-detection:**
- QIDI printers — detection heuristics and print start profile included

**Binaries available but untested:**
- Creality K1 series (K1, K1C, K1 Max) — requires [Simple AF](https://github.com/pellcorp/creality) community firmware
- Creality K2 series (K2, K2 Pro, K2 Plus) — stock firmware has Moonraker on port 4408, no community firmware needed
- Snapmaker U1 — cross-compile target with 480x320 display support exists but has not been tested on hardware

**Active testing underway:**
- SOVOL SV06 — uses Klipper on a Raspberry Pi; install with the [MainsailOS instructions](#raspberry-pi--mainsailos-installation)
- SOVOL SV08 — uses Klipper on a Raspberry Pi; install with the [MainsailOS instructions](#raspberry-pi--mainsailos-installation)
- Elegoo Centauri Carbon 1 — dedicated build target (`cc1`); prebuilt binaries included in releases but no installer support yet (manual deployment only)

**Should work but not yet tested:**
- Other Voron models
- Prusa (with Klipper mod)
- Creality Ender (with Klipper)
- Bambu (with Klipper mod)
- Any custom Klipper build

If you test on a printer not listed above, please let us know your results!

### Which displays are supported?

**Tested and confirmed working:**
- BTT 5" HDMI/DSI touchscreen
- BTT 7" HDMI/DSI touchscreen
- FlashForge AD5M built-in 4.3" display (800x480)

**Should work but not yet tested:**
- Official Raspberry Pi 7" DSI touchscreen
- Creality K2 built-in 4.3" display (480x800, portrait — may need rotation)
- Other HDMI displays
- SPI displays (with proper configuration)

**Display sizes:** HelixScreen auto-detects the best layout for your display. 800x480, 1024x600, and 1920x480 (ultrawide) are fully supported. 480x320 (Snapmaker U1) will run but may have layout overlap issues — improved small-screen support is ongoing.

**Display rotation:** All three binaries (main, splash, watchdog) support 0°, 90°, 180°, and 270° rotation via config or command line.

If you test on hardware not listed above, please let us know your results!

### How is this different from KlipperScreen and GuppyScreen?

| Feature | HelixScreen | KlipperScreen | GuppyScreen |
|---------|-------------|---------------|-------------|
| **UI Framework** | LVGL 9 XML | GTK 3 (Python) | LVGL 8 (C) |
| **Declarative UI** | Full XML | Python only | C only |
| **Disk Size** | ~70-80MB | ~50MB | ~60-80MB |
| **RAM Usage** | ~10MB | ~50MB | ~15-20MB |
| **Reactive Binding** | Built-in | Manual | Manual |
| **3D G-code preview** | Yes | 2D layers | No |
| **3D bed mesh** | Yes | 2D heatmap | 2D heatmap |
| **Status** | Beta | Mature (maintenance) | Unmaintained |

**HelixScreen advantages:**
- Lowest memory footprint
- Declarative XML layouts (change UI without recompiling)
- Modern reactive architecture
- 3D visualizations

### Is HelixScreen production-ready?

HelixScreen is currently in **beta** (closer to alpha). This means:

- ✅ Core features are complete and tested
- ✅ Daily use on real printers works well
- ⚠️ Some edge cases may have bugs
- ⚠️ Some advanced features still in development
- ⚠️ Breaking changes may occur between releases

We recommend it for enthusiasts comfortable with:
- SSH access to their printer
- Reading logs for troubleshooting
- Reporting bugs on GitHub

## Installation

### What Raspberry Pi do I need?

| Pi Model | Supported | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| Pi 5 | ✅ Recommended | Best performance |
| Pi 4 | ✅ Recommended | Great performance |
| Pi 3B+ | ✅ Minimum | Works well |
| Pi 3B | ⚠️ Usable | May be slow |
| Pi Zero 2 W | ✅ OK | Good for space-constrained setups |
| Pi Zero (original) | ❌ No | Too slow |

**Memory:** 1GB minimum, 2GB+ recommended.

**32-bit and 64-bit:** Both are supported. The installer automatically detects your architecture (`uname -m`) and downloads the correct binary — `aarch64` gets the 64-bit build, `armv7l` gets the 32-bit build. No manual selection needed.

### Can I run HelixScreen alongside KlipperScreen/GuppyScreen?

**Not on the same display.** Both compete for the framebuffer. The HelixScreen installer automatically disables any existing screen UI.

**MainsailOS (systemd):**
```bash
# Disable KlipperScreen
sudo systemctl stop KlipperScreen
sudo systemctl disable KlipperScreen

# Enable HelixScreen
sudo systemctl enable helixscreen
sudo systemctl start helixscreen
```

**AD5M Klipper Mod (SysV init):**
```bash
# Disable KlipperScreen
/etc/init.d/S80klipperscreen stop
chmod -x /etc/init.d/S80klipperscreen

# Enable HelixScreen
chmod +x /etc/init.d/S80helixscreen
/etc/init.d/S80helixscreen start
```

**AD5M Forge-X (SysV init):**
```bash
# Disable GuppyScreen
/etc/init.d/S60guppyscreen stop
chmod -x /etc/init.d/S60guppyscreen

# Enable HelixScreen
chmod +x /etc/init.d/S90helixscreen
/etc/init.d/S90helixscreen start
```

If you have two displays, you could theoretically run both (advanced configuration, not tested).

### Do I need to install X11 or a desktop environment?

**No.** HelixScreen renders directly to the framebuffer (fbdev) or DRM. It doesn't need:
- X11 / Xorg
- Wayland
- Desktop environment (GNOME, KDE, etc.)
- Display manager (LightDM, GDM, etc.)

This is why it uses less memory than alternatives.

### Does this work with MainsailOS, FluiddPi, or other Klipper distros?

Yes! HelixScreen works with any Klipper distribution that includes Moonraker:
- MainsailOS ✅
- FluiddPi ✅
- Custom Klipper installs ✅
- KIAUH installs ✅

The web frontend you use (Mainsail, Fluidd, etc.) doesn't matter - HelixScreen talks to Moonraker.

For layout customization, you can edit XML files in `ui_xml/` (no recompilation needed).

### Does it support multiple printers?

**Not currently.** HelixScreen connects to one Moonraker instance. Multi-printer support is on the long-term roadmap.

### Can I view print history?

**Yes.** The History panel shows past prints with statistics, thumbnails, and details. Access via the navbar or home screen.

### Can I send G-code commands directly?

**Yes.** The Console panel lets you send G-code commands and view responses. Access via **Advanced** → **Console**.

### Does it support power device control?

**Yes.** If you have Moonraker power devices configured, the Power panel lets you control them. Access via **Advanced** → **Power**.

### Can I view and run bed mesh?

**Yes.** The Bed Mesh panel shows a 3D visualization of your bed mesh and lets you run calibration. Access via **Controls** → **Bed Mesh**.

### Does it support input shaper?

**Yes.** The Input Shaper panel provides a full calibration workflow with frequency response charts, per-axis results, shaper comparison tables, and Save Config. Access via **Advanced** → **Input Shaper**. Requires an accelerometer configured in Klipper.

### Does it support exclude objects?

**Yes.** During a print, you can exclude objects that failed. Tap the print status area to access exclude object controls.

### Can I run macros?

**Yes.** The Macro panel shows your Klipper macros. Access via **Advanced** → **Macros**. You can also configure quick macro buttons in **Settings** → **Macro Buttons**.

### Can I customize the printer image on the home screen?

**Yes.** Tap the printer image on the Home Panel to open the Printer Manager, then tap the image again to open the Printer Image picker. You have three options:

- **Auto-Detect** (default) — HelixScreen picks an image based on your printer type from Klipper
- **Shipped Images** — Choose from 25+ pre-rendered images (Voron, Creality, FlashForge, Anycubic, RatRig, etc.)
- **Custom Images** — Drop a PNG or JPEG file into `config/custom_images/` and it appears automatically the next time you open the picker. Files must be under 5MB and 2048x2048 pixels max.

Your selection is saved to the `display.printer_image` config key and persists across restarts.

### Can I rename my printer?

**Yes.** Tap the printer image on the Home Panel to open the Printer Manager. Then tap the printer name (shown with a pencil icon) to enable inline editing. Type the new name and press **Enter** to save, or **Escape** to cancel. The name is stored in the `printer.name` config key.

## Usage

### How do I calibrate my touchscreen?

If taps register in the wrong location:
1. Go to **Settings** (gear icon)
2. Scroll to **System** section
3. Tap **Touch Calibration**
4. Tap the crosshairs that appear on screen
5. Calibration saves automatically when complete

Note: This option only appears on touchscreen displays, not in the desktop simulator.

### How do I change the theme or colors?

1. Go to **Settings** → **Display Settings**
2. Tap **Theme** to open the theme editor
3. Browse available presets and see live preview
4. Toggle dark/light mode
5. Tap **Apply** to save (some changes require restart)

### How do I adjust settings during a print?

Tap the **Tune** button on the print status screen to access:
- **Print Speed** (50-200%) - Adjust movement speed
- **Flow Rate** (75-125%) - Adjust extrusion rate
- **Z-Offset** - Baby stepping for first layer adjustment

Fan control is available from the home screen fan widget or controls panel.

### Does HelixScreen support firmware retraction?

**Yes**, if your printer has `[firmware_retraction]` configured in Klipper. Go to **Settings** → **Retraction Settings** (under Printer section) to adjust:
- Retract length and speed
- Unretract extra length and speed
- Enable/disable firmware retraction

This option only appears if Klipper reports firmware retraction capability.

### How do I check why the UI is slow?

1. **Check your display connection:** SPI displays are significantly slower than HDMI or DSI. If possible, use an HDMI or DSI-connected display for best performance.
2. **Disable animations:** Go to **Settings** → toggle **Animations** off
3. **Check CPU/memory via SSH:** Run `top` or `htop` to see if something else is using resources
4. **Reduce logging:** If you added `-vv` or `-vvv` to the service, remove it
5. **Consider a faster SBC:** Pi 4 or Pi 5 will be noticeably smoother than a Pi 3 or Pi Zero

### Why does the setup wizard keep appearing?

The wizard runs when no valid configuration exists. Causes:
1. Config file missing or deleted
2. Config file has invalid JSON
3. Permissions prevent reading config

**Fix:** Check `/opt/helixscreen/config/helixconfig.json` exists and is valid JSON.

### How do I change the Moonraker address?

There's currently no UI to change this after initial setup. Your options:

**Edit the config file directly:**
```bash
sudo nano /opt/helixscreen/config/helixconfig.json
# Edit moonraker_host and moonraker_port in the "printer" section
sudo systemctl restart helixscreen
```

**Or re-run the setup wizard:**
```bash
# Either delete the config to trigger wizard on next start:
sudo rm /opt/helixscreen/config/helixconfig.json
sudo systemctl restart helixscreen

# Or force wizard with command-line flag:
helix-screen --wizard
```
