---

## General

### What is HelixScreen?

HelixScreen is a touchscreen interface for Klipper 3D printers. It connects to your Moonraker instance and provides a modern, touch-friendly UI for controlling your printer.

**Key features:**
- 25+ panels covering all printer operations
- 3D G-code preview and bed mesh visualization
- First-run wizard for easy setup
- Theme editor with multiple presets (dark and light)
- Designed for embedded displays (low memory, no desktop required)

### Which printers are supported?

**Any printer running Klipper + Moonraker** should work. HelixScreen connects to Moonraker's API, not directly to Klipper.

**Tested and confirmed working:**
- Voron 0.1
- Voron 2.4
- FlashForge Adventurer 5M / 5M Pro (with [Forge-X](https://github.com/DrA1ex/ff5m)) — most thoroughly tested on ForgeX 1.4.0 with FlashForge firmware 3.1.5; other versions may work fine

**Should work but not yet tested:**
- Other Voron models
- Prusa (with Klipper mod)
- Creality (K1, Ender with Klipper)
- Bambu (with Klipper mod)
- Ratrig
- Any custom Klipper build

### How is this different from KlipperScreen and GuppyScreen?

| Feature | HelixScreen | KlipperScreen | GuppyScreen |
|---------|-------------|---------------|-------------|
| **UI Framework** | LVGL 9 XML | GTK 3 (Python) | LVGL 8 (C) |
| **Declarative UI** | Full XML | Python only | C only |
| **Disk Size** | ~50-80MB | ~150-200MB | ~60-80MB |
| **RAM Usage** | ~10MB | ~50MB | ~15-20MB |
| **Reactive Binding** | Built-in | Manual | Manual |
| **3D G-code preview** | Yes | 2D layers | No |
| **3D bed mesh** | Yes | 2D heatmap | 2D heatmap |
| **Status** | Beta | Mature (maintenance) | Unmaintained |

**HelixScreen advantages:**
- Lowest memory footprint
- Declarative XML layouts (change UI without recompiling)
- Modern reactive architecture
- 3D visualizations

### Is HelixScreen production-ready?

HelixScreen is currently in **beta** (closer to alpha). This means:

- ✅ Core features are complete and tested
- ✅ Daily use on real printers works well
- ⚠️ Some edge cases may have bugs
- ⚠️ Some advanced features still in development
- ⚠️ Breaking changes may occur between releases

We recommend it for enthusiasts comfortable with:
- SSH access to their printer
- Reading logs for troubleshooting
- Reporting bugs on GitHub

## Installation

### What Raspberry Pi do I need?

| Pi Model | Supported | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| Pi 5 | ✅ Recommended | Best performance |
| Pi 4 | ✅ Recommended | Great performance |
| Pi 3B+ | ✅ Minimum | Works well |
| Pi 3B | ⚠️ Usable | May be slow |
| Pi Zero 2 W | ✅ OK | Good for space-constrained setups |
| Pi Zero (original) | ❌ No | Too slow |

**Memory:** 1GB minimum, 2GB+ recommended.

### Can I run HelixScreen alongside KlipperScreen/GuppyScreen?

**Not on the same display.** Both compete for the framebuffer. The HelixScreen installer automatically disables any existing screen UI.

**MainsailOS (systemd):**
```bash
# Disable KlipperScreen
sudo systemctl stop KlipperScreen
sudo systemctl disable KlipperScreen

# Enable HelixScreen
sudo systemctl enable helixscreen
sudo systemctl start helixscreen
```

**AD5M Klipper Mod (SysV init):**
```bash
# Disable KlipperScreen
/etc/init.d/S80klipperscreen stop
chmod -x /etc/init.d/S80klipperscreen

# Enable HelixScreen
chmod +x /etc/init.d/S80helixscreen
/etc/init.d/S80helixscreen start
```

**AD5M Forge-X (SysV init):**
```bash
# Disable GuppyScreen
/etc/init.d/S60guppyscreen stop
chmod -x /etc/init.d/S60guppyscreen

# Enable HelixScreen
chmod +x /etc/init.d/S90helixscreen
/etc/init.d/S90helixscreen start
```

If you have two displays, you could theoretically run both (advanced configuration, not tested).

### Do I need to install X11 or a desktop environment?

**No.** HelixScreen renders directly to the framebuffer (fbdev) or DRM. It doesn't need:
- X11 / Xorg
- Wayland
- Desktop environment (GNOME, KDE, etc.)
- Display manager (LightDM, GDM, etc.)

This is why it uses less memory than alternatives.

### Does this work with MainsailOS, FluiddPi, or other Klipper distros?

Yes! HelixScreen works with any Klipper distribution that includes Moonraker:
- MainsailOS ✅
- FluiddPi ✅
- Custom Klipper installs ✅
- KIAUH installs ✅

The web frontend you use (Mainsail, Fluidd, etc.) doesn't matter - HelixScreen talks to Moonraker.

## Usage

### How do I calibrate my touchscreen?

If taps register in the wrong location:
1. Go to **Settings** (gear icon)
2. Scroll to **System** section
3. Tap **Touch Calibration**
4. Tap the crosshairs that appear on screen
5. Calibration saves automatically when complete

Note: This option only appears on touchscreen displays, not in the desktop simulator.

### How do I change the theme or colors?

1. Go to **Settings** → **Display Settings**
2. Tap **Theme** to open the theme editor
3. Browse available presets and see live preview
4. Toggle dark/light mode
5. Tap **Apply** to save (some changes require restart)

### How do I adjust settings during a print?

Tap the **Tune** button on the print status screen to access:
- **Print Speed** (50-200%) - Adjust movement speed
- **Flow Rate** (75-125%) - Adjust extrusion rate
- **Z-Offset** - Baby stepping for first layer adjustment

Fan control is available from the home screen fan widget or controls panel.

### Does HelixScreen support firmware retraction?

**Yes**, if your printer has `[firmware_retraction]` configured in Klipper. Go to **Settings** → **Retraction Settings** (under Printer section) to adjust:
- Retract length and speed
- Unretract extra length and speed
- Enable/disable firmware retraction

This option only appears if Klipper reports firmware retraction capability.

### How do I check why the UI is slow?

1. **Check your display connection:** SPI displays are significantly slower than HDMI or DSI. If possible, use an HDMI or DSI-connected display for best performance.
2. **Disable animations:** Go to **Settings** → toggle **Animations** off
3. **Check CPU/memory via SSH:** Run `top` or `htop` to see if something else is using resources
4. **Reduce logging:** If you added `-vv` or `-vvv` to the service, remove it
5. **Consider a faster SBC:** Pi 4 or Pi 5 will be noticeably smoother than a Pi 3 or Pi Zero

### Why does the setup wizard keep appearing?

The wizard runs when no valid configuration exists. Causes:
1. Config file missing or deleted
2. Config file has invalid JSON
3. Permissions prevent reading config

**Fix:** Check `/opt/helixscreen/config/helixconfig.json` exists and is valid JSON.

### How do I change the Moonraker address?

There's currently no UI to change this after initial setup. Your options:

**Edit the config file directly:**
```bash
sudo nano /opt/helixscreen/config/helixconfig.json
# Edit moonraker_host and moonraker_port in the "printer" section
sudo systemctl restart helixscreen
```

**Or re-run the setup wizard:**
```bash
# Either delete the config to trigger wizard on next start:
sudo rm /opt/helixscreen/config/helixconfig.json
sudo systemctl restart helixscreen

# Or force wizard with command-line flag:
helix-screen --wizard
```
