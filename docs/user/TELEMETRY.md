# Telemetry

HelixScreen includes an optional, anonymous telemetry system that helps us understand how the software is used in the real world. This page explains exactly what is collected, how your privacy is protected, and how to control it.

## TL;DR

- Telemetry is **OFF by default**. You must opt in.
- Data is **fully anonymous**. We cannot identify you or your printer.
- You can **view, disable, and delete** your data at any time.
- No filenames, G-code, IP addresses, or personal information is ever collected.

## What Is Collected

HelixScreen collects three types of events when telemetry is enabled:

### Session Events

Recorded once per application launch. Helps us understand the hardware landscape.

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `schema_version` | Event schema version | `1` |
| `event` | Event type identifier | `"session"` |
| `device_id` | Anonymized device identifier (see below) | `"a3f8c1..."` (64-char hex) |
| `timestamp` | ISO 8601 UTC timestamp | `"2026-02-08T14:30:00Z"` |
| `app.version` | HelixScreen version | `"0.9.6"` |
| `app.platform` | Hardware platform | `"rpi4"`, `"rpi5"`, `"x86_64"` |
| `app.display` | Display resolution | `"800x480"` |

### Print Outcome Events

Recorded when a print finishes (success, failure, or cancellation). Helps us track print success rates and understand failure patterns.

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `schema_version` | Event schema version | `1` |
| `event` | Event type identifier | `"print_outcome"` |
| `device_id` | Anonymized device identifier | `"a3f8c1..."` (64-char hex) |
| `timestamp` | ISO 8601 UTC timestamp | `"2026-02-08T16:45:00Z"` |
| `outcome` | Print result | `"success"`, `"failure"`, `"cancelled"` |
| `duration_sec` | Total print duration in seconds | `3600` |
| `phases_completed` | Print start phases completed (0-10) | `10` |
| `filament_used_mm` | Filament consumed in millimeters | `1500.0` |
| `filament_type` | Filament material | `"PLA"`, `"PETG"`, `"ABS"` |
| `nozzle_temp` | Target nozzle temperature in degrees C | `215` |
| `bed_temp` | Target bed temperature in degrees C | `60` |

### Crash Reports

Recorded automatically when HelixScreen crashes. Picked up on the next startup. Helps us catch and fix regressions.

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `schema_version` | Event schema version | `1` |
| `event` | Event type identifier | `"crash"` |
| `device_id` | Anonymized device identifier | `"a3f8c1..."` (64-char hex) |
| `timestamp` | ISO 8601 UTC timestamp | `"2026-02-08T12:00:00Z"` |
| `signal` | POSIX signal number | `11` |
| `signal_name` | Signal name | `"SIGSEGV"`, `"SIGABRT"`, `"SIGBUS"`, `"SIGFPE"` |
| `app_version` | HelixScreen version at time of crash | `"0.9.6"` |
| `uptime_sec` | Seconds since application started | `3600` |
| `backtrace` | Stack frame addresses (hex) | `["0x0040abcd", "0x0040ef01"]` |

## What Is NOT Collected

HelixScreen **never** collects any of the following:

- **Filenames** or file paths (print jobs, G-code files, thumbnails)
- **G-code content** (sliced files, macros, custom commands)
- **IP addresses** (local or public)
- **MAC addresses** or other network identifiers
- **Hostnames** (printer name, device name, Klipper instance name)
- **Usernames** or account credentials
- **Camera data** (images, video, webcam streams)
- **WiFi SSIDs** or network topology
- **Serial numbers** (printer, board, display)
- **Macro names** or custom configuration
- **Moonraker API keys** or authentication tokens
- **Email addresses** or contact information

---

## How Anonymization Works

Each HelixScreen installation generates a random UUID v4 identifier on first launch. This UUID is used **only** to correlate events from the same device across sessions (so we can track things like "devices that crash also tend to have shorter print times"). The UUID itself **never leaves your device**.

Instead, before including the device identifier in any event, HelixScreen computes a **double SHA-256 hash**:

```
device_id = SHA-256( SHA-256(uuid) + device_local_salt )
```

The salt is a second random UUID v4, also generated locally and stored alongside the original UUID. Both values are stored in your local config directory and never transmitted.

This double-hash design means:

- The transmitted `device_id` cannot be reversed to recover the original UUID
- Even if the telemetry server were compromised, your device identity remains protected
- Two devices with different salts will always produce different device IDs, even if they somehow generated the same UUID
- **Re-identification is impossible** without access to the device's local files

---

## Default State

Telemetry is **OFF by default**. No data is collected, queued, or transmitted until you explicitly enable it through the Settings panel.

---

## How to Enable or Disable

1. Navigate to **Settings** on the HelixScreen home panel
2. Find the **Telemetry** section
3. Toggle **Share Usage Data** on or off

When you disable telemetry:
- No new events are recorded
- No queued events are transmitted
- Previously queued events remain in the local queue (use "Clear All Events" to delete them)

When you re-enable telemetry:
- A new session event is recorded on the next app launch
- Print outcomes and crashes resume being recorded
- Any previously queued events will be included in the next transmission

---

## How to View Your Data

You can inspect exactly what HelixScreen has queued for transmission:

1. Navigate to **Settings**
2. Tap **Telemetry**
3. Tap **View Telemetry Data**

This opens an overlay showing all queued events in their raw JSON format, which is exactly what would be sent to the server.

---

## How to Clear Your Data

To delete all locally queued telemetry events:

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Telemetry** > **View Telemetry Data**
2. Tap **Clear All Events**

This permanently removes all queued events from your device. Events that have already been transmitted to the server cannot be individually deleted (see the [Privacy Policy](PRIVACY_POLICY.md) for details on why server-side data is inherently anonymous).

---

## Data Retention and Transmission

### Local Queue
- Events are stored locally in `telemetry_queue.json` in your config directory
- Maximum **100 events** in the queue; oldest events are dropped when the limit is reached
- Queue persists across application restarts

### Transmission
- Events are sent via **HTTPS POST** to `https://telemetry.helixscreen.org/v1/events`
- Batched in groups of up to **20 events** per request
- Transmission is attempted every **24 hours** when telemetry is enabled
- On failure, exponential backoff is applied (doubling interval, capped at 7 days)
- On success, sent events are removed from the local queue
- User-Agent header includes the HelixScreen version (e.g., `HelixScreen/0.9.6`)

## Why We Collect This Data

Telemetry helps us make HelixScreen better in specific, measurable ways:

- **Hardware landscape**: Knowing which platforms and display resolutions are most common helps us prioritize testing and optimization
- **Print success rates**: Understanding failure patterns across the user base helps us identify and fix issues that affect real prints
- **Crash regressions**: Crash reports with backtraces let us catch and fix bugs that might only appear on specific hardware or under specific conditions
- **Development priorities**: Aggregate usage data helps us focus engineering effort where it matters most

We believe in earning trust through transparency. That is why the telemetry system is opt-in, the data is viewable, and this document exists.

## Technical Details

For developers and the technically curious:

- **Source code**: `src/system/telemetry_manager.cpp`, `include/system/telemetry_manager.h`
- **Crash handler**: `src/system/crash_handler.cpp` (async-signal-safe, no heap allocation in signal handler)
- **Schema version**: `1` (all events include `schema_version` for forward compatibility)
- **Identity files**: `telemetry_device.json` (UUID + salt), `telemetry_config.json` (enabled state), `telemetry_queue.json` (event queue)
- **Privacy policy**: [PRIVACY_POLICY.md](PRIVACY_POLICY.md)
