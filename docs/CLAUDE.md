Each subdirectory has its own `CLAUDE.md` with context-specific guidance.

## Quick Routing

| I need to... | Go to |
|--------------|-------|
| Look up how a system works | `devel/CLAUDE.md` — find the feature doc |
| Write/update user-facing docs | `user/CLAUDE.md` — style rules for end users |
| Find XML widget docs | `devel/LVGL9_XML_GUIDE.md` |
| Understand modal patterns | `devel/MODAL_SYSTEM.md` |
| Check a feature's architecture | `devel/ARCHITECTURE.md` |
| See what's planned/complete | `devel/ROADMAP.md` |
| Update the doc index | `README.md` + this file + relevant `CLAUDE.md` |

## Writing Documentation

- Developer docs go in `devel/`, user docs go in `user/`
- Follow the style of existing docs (see `devel/SOUND_SYSTEM.md` or `devel/MODAL_SYSTEM.md`)
- Developer docs: include overview, key files table, architecture, real code examples, developer extension guide
- User docs: step-by-step, no source code references, copy-pasteable commands
- No SPDX headers on docs (only on source code)
- Keep code examples real — pull from actual files, don't invent
- When adding new docs, update: this file, `README.md`, and `devel/CLAUDE.md` or `user/CLAUDE.md`
