# Preprint ETA Prediction

How HelixScreen predicts the duration of PRINT_START macro phases (heating, homing, leveling, etc.) and displays real-time remaining time estimates during print preparation.

---

## Overview

Every 3D print begins with a preparation sequence: heating the bed and nozzle, homing axes, probing the bed mesh, purging filament. On many printers this takes 2-10 minutes, but the user has no visibility into how long it will take.

The preprint prediction system solves this by:

1. **Recording** per-phase durations each time a print starts (homing took 25s, bed mesh took 90s, etc.)
2. **Persisting** the last 3 timing entries to disk
3. **Predicting** future preparation time using a weighted average that favors recent entries
4. **Displaying** a live countdown during preparation ("~3:20 left") that accounts for completed and in-progress phases

The system is entirely opportunistic: if no history exists, no prediction is shown. Predictions improve with each completed print.

## Architecture

```
PrintStartCollector (owns lifecycle, phase detection, timing)
  |
  +-> PreprintPredictor (pure logic: weighted averages, remaining time)
  |     No LVGL, no Config, no threads. Fully unit-testable.
  |
  +-> Config persistence (/print_start_history/entries in helixconfig.json)
  |
  +-> PrinterState subjects (print_start_time_left, preprint_remaining, preprint_elapsed)
        |
        +-> XML bindings (home_panel.xml, print_status_panel.xml)
        +-> PrintStatusPanel observers (remaining/elapsed display integration)
```

### Key Design Decisions

- **PreprintPredictor is a pure-logic class** with zero dependencies on LVGL, Config, or threading. This makes it trivially testable.
- **PrintStartCollector owns the predictor instance** and manages loading/saving. It also owns the LVGL timer that periodically updates the ETA display.
- **Static convenience method** `PreprintPredictor::predicted_total_from_config()` allows UI code (print select panel, print status panel) to get predictions without access to the collector.

---

## PreprintPredictor Engine

### Data Model

```cpp
struct PreprintEntry {
    int total_seconds;                  // Total pre-print duration
    int64_t timestamp;                  // Unix timestamp when recorded
    std::map<int, int> phase_durations; // PrintStartPhase enum -> seconds
};
```

Phase keys are integer values of the `PrintStartPhase` enum:

| Value | Phase | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 0 | IDLE | Not in PRINT_START |
| 1 | INITIALIZING | PRINT_START detected |
| 2 | HOMING | G28 / Home All Axes |
| 3 | HEATING_BED | M140/M190 |
| 4 | HEATING_NOZZLE | M104/M109 |
| 5 | QGL | QUAD_GANTRY_LEVEL |
| 6 | Z_TILT | Z_TILT_ADJUST |
| 7 | BED_MESH | Bed mesh calibrate/load |
| 8 | CLEANING | Nozzle wipe |
| 9 | PURGING | Purge line |
| 10 | COMPLETE | Transition to printing |

Only phases 2-9 are tracked for timing. IDLE, INITIALIZING, and COMPLETE are lifecycle markers.

### FIFO Entry Management

The predictor keeps a maximum of **3 entries** (newest at the end of the vector). When a 4th entry is added, the oldest is evicted. This keeps predictions responsive to changes (new filament, different room temperature) without being thrown off by a single outlier.

```
Entry added -> entries_.push_back(entry)
              -> while (size > 3) erase(begin)  // FIFO trim
```

`load_entries()` replaces all existing data and also trims to 3 if more are provided.

---

## Weighted History Averaging

Predictions use a **recency-weighted average** where newer entries count more. The weights depend on how many entries are available:

| Entries | Weights (oldest -> newest) | Rationale |
|---------|---------------------------|-----------|
| 1 | 100% | Only data point |
| 2 | 40%, 60% | Favor recent |
| 3 | 20%, 30%, 50% | Strong recency bias |

### Per-Phase Calculation

Each phase is predicted independently. This matters because not all prints go through the same phases (some skip bed mesh, some skip QGL).

For each phase that appears in *any* entry:

1. Collect the entries that have timing data for this phase
2. **Redistribute weights** among only those entries (normalize to sum to 1.0)
3. Compute the weighted average and round to the nearest integer

**Example**: Three entries, but only entries 0 and 2 recorded HEATING_BED:

```
Base weights: [0.2, 0.3, 0.5]  (3-entry scheme)
Entry 0 has HEATING_BED: 80s   (weight 0.2)
Entry 1 does NOT have HEATING_BED
Entry 2 has HEATING_BED: 100s  (weight 0.5)

Redistribute: total_weight = 0.2 + 0.5 = 0.7
  Entry 0: 80 * (0.2/0.7) = 22.9s
  Entry 2: 100 * (0.5/0.7) = 71.4s
  Predicted HEATING_BED = round(22.9 + 71.4) = 94s
```

The `predicted_total()` is the sum of all per-phase predictions.

---

## Anomaly Rejection (15-Minute Threshold)

Entries with `total_seconds > 900` (15 minutes) are silently rejected by `add_entry()`. This protects against:

- **Cancelled prints** where the user walked away and restarted much later
- **Firmware hangs** during homing or probing that required manual intervention
- **Abnormal heating** due to a thermistor issue or cold environment

The threshold is defined as `MAX_TOTAL_SECONDS = 900` and applies only at insertion time. Entries loaded from config via `load_entries()` are not filtered (they were already validated when originally added).

Entries at exactly 900 seconds are accepted (the check is `>`, not `>=`).

---

## Phase Timing Tracking

Phase durations are computed from timestamps, not explicitly timed:

1. When `update_phase()` is called with a new phase, the enter time is recorded in `phase_enter_times_` (a `map<int, steady_clock::time_point>`)
2. On COMPLETE, `save_prediction_entry()` sorts phases by enter time and computes each phase's duration as the interval to the next phase (or to "now" for the last phase)

```
Phase enter times:          Duration calculation:
  HOMING      @ T+0s         HOMING: T+25 - T+0  = 25s
  HEATING_BED @ T+25s        HEATING_BED: T+115 - T+25 = 90s
  BED_MESH    @ T+115s       BED_MESH: T+145 - T+115 = 30s
  PURGING     @ T+145s       PURGING: now - T+145 = ~20s
```

IDLE, INITIALIZING, and COMPLETE phases are excluded from timing.

---

## Real-Time Remaining Calculation

`remaining_seconds()` provides a live countdown during preparation:

```cpp
int remaining_seconds(
    const std::set<int>& completed_phases,  // Phases already done
    int current_phase,                       // Phase we're currently in
    int elapsed_in_current_phase_seconds     // Time spent in current phase
) const;
```

The algorithm:

1. Get per-phase predictions from the weighted average
2. For **completed phases**: skip (actual time was spent, not predicted)
3. For **current phase**: `max(0, predicted - elapsed)` (counts down as time passes)
4. For **future phases**: add full predicted duration

If elapsed exceeds the prediction for the current phase, that phase contributes 0 (never negative). This prevents the remaining time from going negative if a phase runs longer than expected.

### Update Frequency

An LVGL timer (`eta_timer_`) fires every **5 seconds** and calls `update_eta_display()`, which:

1. Updates `preprint_elapsed_seconds` subject (total time since preparation started)
2. Queries `remaining_seconds()` with current phase state
3. Updates `preprint_remaining_seconds` subject (integer, for programmatic use)
4. Formats and sets `print_start_time_left` subject (string, e.g. "~3:20 left")

When remaining reaches 0, the display shows "Almost ready".

---

## History Persistence

### Storage Location

Entries are stored in the main config file (`config/helixconfig.json`) at the JSON path `/print_start_history/entries`.

### JSON Schema

```json
{
  "print_start_history": {
    "entries": [
      {
        "total": 165,
        "timestamp": 1700000000,
        "phases": {
          "2": 25,
          "3": 90,
          "7": 30,
          "9": 20
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

- `total`: Total pre-print seconds (sum of phase durations)
- `timestamp`: Unix timestamp when the entry was recorded
- `phases`: Map of `PrintStartPhase` enum int (as string key) to duration in seconds

### Save Flow

1. `PrintStartCollector::save_prediction_entry()` computes durations from `phase_enter_times_`
2. Adds the entry to the in-memory predictor via `add_entry()` (which enforces the 15-min cap)
3. Gets all entries from the predictor and serializes to JSON
4. Schedules a `Config::set()` + `Config::save()` via `async::invoke()` on the main thread

### Load Flow

1. `PrintStartCollector::start()` calls `load_prediction_history()`
2. Which calls `PreprintPredictor::load_entries_from_config()` (static method)
3. Reads JSON from Config, deserializes to `vector<PreprintEntry>`
4. Passes to predictor's `load_entries()`

### Caching

`predicted_total_from_config()` caches its result for **60 seconds** using atomic variables. This avoids re-parsing config JSON for every file in the print selection list (each file card calls this to augment the slicer time estimate with preprint overhead).

## Integration with Print Status UI

### LVGL Subjects

Three subjects carry prediction data from the collector to the UI:

| Subject Name | Type | Description |
|-------------|------|-------------|
| `print_start_time_left` | string | Formatted ETA (e.g., "~2:30 left", "Almost ready", or "") |
| `preprint_remaining` | int | Remaining seconds for pre-print (for programmatic use) |
| `preprint_elapsed` | int | Seconds since preparation started |

### XML Bindings

**Home panel** (`home_panel.xml`): Shows the ETA text below the phase message during preparation:
```xml
<text_small name="print_start_eta" bind_text="print_start_time_left"
            style_text_color="#text_muted"/>
```

**Print status panel** (`print_status_panel.xml`): Shows ETA in the progress overlay:
```xml
<text_small name="preparing_eta" bind_text="print_start_time_left"
            style_text_color="#overlay_text" style_text_opa="180"/>
```

### PrintStatusPanel Observer Integration

The print status panel uses `preprint_remaining` and `preprint_elapsed` observers to take over the standard elapsed/remaining time displays during the Preparing state:

- **`on_preprint_elapsed_changed()`**: During Preparing, updates the elapsed time display. This provides accurate phase-level elapsed tracking (Moonraker's `total_duration` includes all time since the job was queued, which may not align with actual preparation start).

- **`on_preprint_remaining_changed()`**: During Preparing, combines the preprint remaining seconds with the slicer's estimated print time to show a total wall-clock remaining time. Formula: `slicer_time + preprint_remaining`.

- **State transition to Printing**: When the state changes from Preparing to Printing, the panel transitions the remaining display back to Moonraker's `time_left` value. Without this explicit transition, the display would stay stuck on the last preprint prediction value.

### Print Select Panel Integration

The print file browser (`ui_panel_print_select.cpp`) augments the slicer's estimated print time with the predicted preprint overhead:

```cpp
int preprint_seconds = helix::PreprintPredictor::predicted_total_from_config();
int total_minutes = print_time_minutes + (preprint_seconds + 30) / 60;
```

This gives users a more realistic wall-clock time estimate that includes heating and preparation, not just the slicer's extrusion time.

## Troubleshooting Inaccurate Predictions

### Predictions Too High

- **Cause**: History includes entries where heating took unusually long (cold room, different filament requiring higher temp).
- **Fix**: Predictions naturally improve after 2-3 prints as old entries are evicted by FIFO.

### Predictions Too Low

- **Cause**: New phase added to PRINT_START macro (e.g., added QGL) that wasn't in history.
- **Fix**: The system handles missing phases via weight redistribution. After 1-2 prints with the new phase, predictions will include it.

### No Predictions Shown

- **Cause**: No print history exists yet (fresh install or config reset).
- **Fix**: Complete one print. The prediction system activates after the first recorded entry.

### Predictions Not Updating

- **Cause**: Entries being rejected by the 15-minute anomaly filter.
- **Debug**: Run with `-vv` and look for `[PrintStartCollector] Saved prediction history` or `No phase timings to save` log messages. If entries are being rejected, check if your PRINT_START macro genuinely takes over 15 minutes.

### Clearing Prediction History

Delete the `print_start_history` key from `config/helixconfig.json` and restart:

```json
{
  "print_start_history": {
    "entries": []
  }
}
```

## Developer Guide: Tuning Weights

### Changing the Weighting Scheme

Weights are defined in `PreprintPredictor::predicted_phases()` in `src/print/preprint_predictor.cpp`:

```cpp
switch (entries_.size()) {
case 1:  weights = {1.0};           break;
case 2:  weights = {0.4, 0.6};     break;
default: weights = {0.2, 0.3, 0.5}; break;
}
```

To change the recency bias, modify these weights. They do **not** need to sum to 1.0 because weight redistribution normalizes them per-phase. However, keeping them summing to 1.0 makes the behavior more predictable.

**More aggressive recency** (ignores old data faster):
```cpp
default: weights = {0.1, 0.2, 0.7}; break;
```

**More conservative** (smooths out variance):
```cpp
default: weights = {0.3, 0.35, 0.35}; break;
```

### Changing the History Depth

`MAX_ENTRIES` controls how many entries are kept. The default is 3. Increasing it:

- **Pros**: More data smooths out outliers
- **Cons**: Slower to adapt to changes (new filament, different printer config)

If you increase `MAX_ENTRIES` beyond 3, you must also add weight vectors for the new sizes to `predicted_phases()`. The `default` case handles 3+ entries but only uses 3 weights, which means entries beyond 3 are silently ignored in the weighting. To support 4+ entries properly:

```cpp
case 4: weights = {0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4}; break;
```

### Changing the Anomaly Threshold

`MAX_TOTAL_SECONDS = 900` (15 minutes). Adjust if your printer legitimately takes longer than 15 minutes to prepare (e.g., very large bed requiring extended heating).

### Changing the ETA Update Interval

`ETA_UPDATE_INTERVAL_MS = 5000` in `print_start_collector.h`. Lower values give smoother countdowns but consume more CPU. Since the countdown subtracts elapsed time in real-time, 5 seconds is a reasonable balance.

## Testing

Unit tests are in `tests/unit/test_preprint_predictor.cpp` with tag `[print][predictor]`:

```bash
./build/bin/helix-tests "[predictor]"
```

Tests cover:
- Empty state (no predictions without history)
- Single entry (100% weight)
- Two entries (60/40 weighting)
- Three entries (50/30/20 weighting)
- FIFO trimming (4th entry evicts oldest)
- 15-minute anomaly rejection (901s rejected, 900s accepted)
- Phases appearing in subset of entries (weight redistribution)
- Remaining time with no progress, partial progress, exceeded prediction
- All phases completed returns 0
- Unknown current phase contributes 0
- `load_entries` replaces existing data
- `load_entries` caps at 3

The predictor has no LVGL or Config dependencies, making tests fast and deterministic.
