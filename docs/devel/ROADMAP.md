## Recently Completed

### XML Engine Extraction & LVGL 9.5 Upgrade ✅
**Completed:** 2026-02-18

Extracted the LVGL XML engine into standalone `lib/helix-xml/` library and upgraded LVGL from 9.4-pre to v9.5.0, gaining 274 commits of improvements (blur, drop shadow, flex rounding fixes, memory leak fixes, gesture threshold API, slot support). XML patches baked permanently into helix-xml; LVGL patches regenerated for v9.5. New umbrella headers (`helix_xml.h`), standalone globals, and forward declaration files decouple helix-xml from LVGL internals.

**Branch:** `feature/helix-xml` | **Plan:** `docs/devel/plans/2026-02-18-helix-xml-plan.md`

### Power Panel Integration ✅
**Completed:** 2026-02-18

Home panel quick-toggle button for power devices (tap to toggle, long-press for full panel), Advanced panel entry with conditional visibility via `power_device_count` capability subject, device selection chips for choosing which devices the home button controls, and auto-discovery of Moonraker power devices on connect.

**Files:** `ui_panel_power.cpp`, `ui_panel_home.cpp`, `printer_capabilities_state.cpp`

### Multi-Unit AMS ✅
**Completed:** 2026-02-17

Multi-unit AMS overview panel, shared detail components (DRY refactor), per-slot error visualization with buffer health, AFC/Happy Hare device management overlays, mock backend deduplication via shared defaults modules. Visual verification complete.

**Branch:** `feature/multi-unit-ams` (76 commits, 146 files, +34k/-14k lines)

### Debug Bundle Upload ✅
**Completed:** 2026-02-16

Support diagnostics system for remote troubleshooting:
- **Debug bundle collector** gathers logs, crash data, config, and system info
- **Upload to Cloudflare Worker** endpoint for support team access
- **Modal UI** with progress feedback in Settings panel
- 193 unit tests

**Files:** `debug_bundle_collector.cpp`, `ui_debug_bundle_modal.cpp`

### Probe Management Overlay ✅
**Completed:** 2026-02-15

Probe configuration and management overlay in Advanced panel:
- **Auto-detection** of probe types: Cartographer, Beacon, Tap, Klicky, BLTouch, eddy current
- **BLTouch panel** with live Z-offset adjustment
- **First-run wizard step** for probe sensor selection
- Hidden when no probe detected

**Files:** `ui_probe_overlay.cpp`, `ui_xml/probe_overlay.xml`, `ui_xml/probe_bltouch_panel.xml`

### Active Extruder Temperature Tracking ✅
**Completed:** 2026-02-16

Unified temperature tracking for multi-extruder/multi-tool printers:
- Dynamic nozzle label showing active tool number
- `PrinterTemperatureState` tracks active extruder across tool changes
- Integrated with LED auto-state and telemetry

### Z-Axis Direction Flip Toggle ✅
**Completed:** 2026-02-15

Settings option to invert Z movement buttons for printers where the auto-detection heuristic gets it wrong.

### Hardware Discovery Improvements ✅
**Completed:** 2026-02-16

Skip expected hardware in new discovery check — reduces false-positive "new hardware detected" prompts after initial wizard setup.

## Current Priorities

### 1. Plugin Ecosystem

**Status:** Core infrastructure complete, expanding ecosystem

The plugin system launched with version checking, UI injection points, and async execution.

**Next steps:**
- [ ] LED Effects plugin → production quality
- [ ] Additional plugin examples for community
- [ ] Plugin documentation refinement

**Files:** `src/plugin_manager.cpp`, `docs/PLUGIN_DEVELOPMENT.md`

### 2. Production Hardening

Remaining items for production readiness:
- [ ] Structured logging with log rotation
- [ ] Edge case testing (print failures, filesystem errors)
- [ ] Streaming file operations verified on AD5M with 50MB+ G-code files

## Backlog (Lower Priority)

| Feature | Effort | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| **Lazy panel initialization** | Medium | Defer `init_subjects()` until first nav; blocked on LVGL XML subject timing |
| **Camera/Webcam** | Low | Lower priority for local touchscreen use case |
| **Belt tension visualization** | Future | Accelerometer-based CoreXY belt comparison; reuses frequency chart |
| **OTA updates** | Future | UpdateChecker downloads + installs; needs auto-apply without user interaction |

See `docs/devel/IDEAS.md` for additional ideas and design rationale.

## Known Technical Debt

See `docs/ARCHITECTURAL_DEBT.md` for the full register.

**Resolved (2026-01):**
- ~~PrinterState god class~~ → Decomposed into 13 domain classes
- ~~PrintStatusPanel~~ → Extracted 8 focused components
- ~~SettingsPanel~~ → Extracted 5 overlay components

**Remaining:**
- **Application class** (1249 lines) → Extract bootstrapper and runtime
- **Singleton cascade pattern** → UIPanelContext value object
- **Code duplication** → PanelBase/OverlayBase with RAII subjects (complete)
- **NavigationManager intimacy** → Extract INavigable interface

---

## Design Philosophy

HelixScreen is a **local touchscreen** UI - users are physically present at the printer. This fundamentally differs from web UIs (Mainsail/Fluidd) designed for remote monitoring.

**We prioritize:**
- Tactile controls optimized for touch
- At-a-glance information for the user standing at the machine
- Calibration workflows (PID, Z-offset, screws tilt, input shaper)
- Real-time tuning (speed, flow, firmware retraction)

**Lower priority for this form factor:**
- Camera (you can see the printer with your eyes)
- Job queue (requires manual print removal between jobs)
- System stats (CPU/memory) — not diagnosing remote issues
- Remote access/monitoring features

Don't copy features from web UIs just because "competitors have it" — evaluate whether it makes sense for a local touchscreen.
